# 03 Agents

## Overview
Building intelligent agents with tool calling, retrieval capabilities, and Unity Catalog functions.

## Learning Objectives
- Create agents with retriever tools using LangChain
- Build advanced agents with LangGraph and conditional routing
- Integrate Unity Catalog functions as agent tools
- Implement multi-turn conversations with state management

## Prerequisites
- Vector Search index (from `01_fundamentals/`)
- Unity Catalog schema for function registration
- Databricks Genie space (for advanced agent)
